.SH NAME
pipetty \- a tool to pipe from a pseudoterminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pipetty
.I command
[
.I args...\&
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pipetty
lets you make a program unaware that its output is being redirected.
This is usually useful for tools that detect whether they're run from a
terminal and modify their output, typically colorizing it only when run
interactively.
.P
Usually, disabling colors when redirected is a good thing as most tools
can't cope with ANSI codes.  Use
.B pipetty
when you do want colors, like when you're going to feed that output to
.B ansi2html
or
.BR "less -R" .
.SH CAVEATS
Certain programs, such as
.BR bash ,
don't quite like their stdin to be on a different terminal than stdout.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR ansi2html (1),
.BR ansi2txt (1),
.BR less (1).
