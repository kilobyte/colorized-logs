Description: tools for consuming logs with ANSI color
 Some tools like gcc, dmesg, grep --color, colordiff, ccze, etc can enhance
 their output with color, making reading a lot more pleasant.  You can
 usually view that only on your terminal or with "less -R"; this package
 gives you:
  * ansi2html: convert logs to HTML
  * ansi2txt: drop ANSI control codes
  * ttyrec2ansi: drop timing data from ttyrec files
  * pipetty: makes a program think its stdout and stderr are connected to a
    terminal; use as a prefix: "pipetty dmesg|tee"
  * lesstty: pipe a program (as above) to "less -R"
